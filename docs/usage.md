# GP2040 Usage

## Buttons

GP2040 uses a generic button labeling for gamepad state, which is then converted to the appropriate input type before sending. This table provides a map of GP2040 buttons to common gamepads/layouts:

| GP2040  | XInput | Switch  | PS3          | DirectInput  | Arcade |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| B1      | A      | B       | Cross        | 2            | K1     |
| B2      | B      | A       | Circle       | 3            | K2     |
| B3      | X      | Y       | Square       | 1            | P1     |

## Home Button

If you do not have a dedicated Home button, you can activate it via the **`BACK + START + UP`** button combination.

## Input Modes

To change the input mode, **hold one of the following buttons as the controller is plugged in (Arcade mapping in parentheses):**

* **`B1 (K1)`** for Nintendo Switch
* **`B2 (K2)`** for XInput
* **`B3 (P1)`** for DirectInput/PS3

Input mode is saved across power cycles.

## D-Pad Modes

You can switch between the 3 modes for the D-Pad **while the controller is in use by pressing one of the following combinations:**

* **`S1 + S2 + DOWN`** - D-Pad
* **`S1 + S2 + LEFT`** - Emulate Left Analog stick
* **`S1 + S2 + RIGHT`** - Emulate Right Analog stick

D-Pad mode is saved across power cycles.

## SOCD Modes

Simultaneous Opposite Cardinal Direction (SOCD) cleaning will ensure the controller doesn't send invalid directional inputs to the computer/console, like Left + Right at the same time. There are 3 modes to choose from **while the controller is in use by pressing one of the following combinations:**

* **`L3 + R3 + UP`** - **Up Priority mode**: Up + Down = Up, Left + Right = Neutral (Hitbox behavior)
* **`L3 + R3 + DOWN`** - **Neutral mode**: Up + Down = Neutral, Left + Right = Neutral
* **`L3 + R3 + LEFT`** - **Last Input Priority (Last Win)**: Hold Up then hold Down = Down, then release and re-press Up = Up. Applies to both axes.

SOCD mode is saved across power cycles.

## RGB LEDs

> LED modes are available on the Pico Fighting Board, Crush Counter/OSFRD and custom builds only.
